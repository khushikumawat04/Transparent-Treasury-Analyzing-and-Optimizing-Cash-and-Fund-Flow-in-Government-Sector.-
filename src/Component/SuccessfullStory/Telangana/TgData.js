    content1:"While the project duration of WDC-PMKSY/IWMP project varies from 4-7 years and as a result the WDC-PMKSY/IWMP projects are yet to be completed, some impacts are now visible in many parts of the country. The construction of water harvesting structures under IWMP has helped in improving the water availability and incomes to the farmers living in the project areas. Some of the successful interventions under WDC-PMKSY/IWMP which have impacted the livelihoods of rural poor and contributed in enhancing their incomes are given in the subsequent paragraphs",
    content2:"Construction of Soil and Water Conservation Structures in Gunjala village of Adilabad district, Telangana Gunjala, a tribal village of Tamsi Mandal in Adilabad district of Telangana ( Gunjala micro watershed - IWMP-I /2009-10) had been suffering from three major problems (i) very low ground water table (below 300-400 ft.),(ii) unavailability of reliable natural water source and (iii) absence of any man made water harvesting structures. To address these problems, water retaining structures like loose boulder structures (97 nos)",
    content3:" rock field dams (31 nos), percolation tanks (2 nos) and check dams (3 nos.) were constructed with an expenditure of Rs.39.12 lakhs under IWMP project. The Intervention improved water harvesting potential of the watershed, and increased productivity of the land. The harvested water was used for supplementing irrigation. There was significant increase in the productivity of cotton (from 6.5 Q/acre to 10 Q/acre) and redgram (from 1.4 Q/acre to 3 Q/acre). These water retaining structures also improved the groundwater level. The change was visible in terms of the increased income flows to the command area households.",
