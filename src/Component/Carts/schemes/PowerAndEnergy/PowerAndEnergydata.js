        discription:"Hydro power projects are classified as large and small hydro projects based on their sizes. Different countries have different size criteria to classify small hydro power projects. In India, hydro power plants with capacity of 25 MW or below are classified as small hydro. Hydro Power was looked after by Ministry of Power prior to 1989. In 1989, plant capacity up to 3MW and below was transferred to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE). Thereafter, many initiatives were taken by this Ministry since then for the promotion of small hydro which included implementation of a UNDP-GEF assisted Technical Assistance project entitled “Optimizing Development of Small Hydro Resources in Hilly Regions of India”  and India-Renewable Resources Development Project with IDA credit line having interalia small hydro development component with target of 100MW canal based small hydro power projects through private sector participation. Subsequently plant capacity up to 25MW and below was entrusted with the MNRE in November 1999.",

    discription:"Biomass has always been an important energy source for the country considering the benefits it offers.  It is renewable, widely available, carbon-neutral and has the potential to provide significant employment in the rural areas.  Biomass is also capable of providing firm energy.  About 32% of the total primary energy use in the country is still derived from biomass and more than 70% of the country’s population depends upon it for its energy needs.  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has realised the potential and role of biomass energy in the Indian context and hence has initiated a number of programmes for promotion of efficient technologies for its use in various sectors of the economy to ensure derivation of maximum benefits.  For efficient utilization of biomass, bagasse based cogeneration in sugar mills and biomass power generation have been taken up under biomass power and cogeneration programme.",
